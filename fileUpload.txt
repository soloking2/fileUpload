File Upload Code sample

This code makes use of HTML5, JavaScript/Ajax, and PHP

JavaScript
1. uploadFileHandler function

created a file variable and assigned it to the id of the file to be uploaded 
and the object reference for what is being uploaded was 
assessed using the files array.
An instance of the object FormData() was called for the compilation of key/value
pairs to be sent through AJAX XMLHttpRequest;
The append method was added to the object instance and the method was passed in
the value contained in the input name('uploadFile'), and the variable holding 
the reference of the image being uploded.

An Ajax request was initialized and assigned to the valiable ajax;
An event listener which contained the "progress" event listener, the progressHandler
function and set the event propagation to false was added to ajax.upload.
The .upload added to the ajax is to be able to get the event loaded size and 
the event total size.

An event listener which contained the "load" event listener, the completeHandler
function and set the event propagation to false was added to ajax.

An event listener which contained the "error" event listener, the errorHandler
function and set the event propagation to false was added to ajax.

An event listener which contained the "abort" event listener, the abortHandler
function and set the event propagation to false was added to ajax.

The open method was called; POST method was specified, the url of the file location
and the asynchronous was set to true.
The send method was used to send the object instance to the url.

2.	progressHandler function
The event parameter was passed to the progressHandler function which dynamically
tracks the properties of any object that was to be uploaded.
The content of the element containing the progress of the uploded file was 
changed to carry the measure of the target's size being uploaded.
The percentage was calculated and was passed into the progress bar value;
The element carrying the status was changed to indicate download progress.


3.	completeHandler function
The event parameter was passed to the completeHandler function which dynamically
presents the XMLHttpRequest() response from the url on the object that was uploaded.
The value of the uploaded picture was removed.

4.	errorHandler function
The event parameter was passed to the errorHandler function which dynamically
tracks the error of any object that was to be uploaded.

5.	abortHandler function
The event parameter was passed to the abortHandler function which dynamically
tracks the error of any object that was to be uploaded and aborts the process.



PHP
checked if the file is set and the name is not empty.
created a variable and assigned it to the directory name inside my root folder
The $fileName specifies the name uploaded
$file_tmp specifies the name of the image to be uploaded.
$fileType specifies the type of the image.
$fileSize specifies the size of the image.
$fileErr specifies error during upload.
$extension finds a part of the image name (extension) after the dot e.g (jpg).
$max_size specifies the maximum size to upload
$uploaded_file specifies the path of the image to be uploaded
$uploadMeasure assigns true if any condition is met

checked if the image sent is real or fake i.e. if its has width and height, and
a file type 

Checked to know if the image that is being uploaded is already in the directory

Checked to know if the size of the image that is being uploaded is higher than
the maximum size specified

Checked to know if the extension type matche the permitted ones.

When the conditions are met, the image can be allowed to be uploaded.


MOTIVATIONS
Writing this code was really not very easy. Needed to know Ajax to fully implement this technique. At fast I was abit perplexed because i was getting errors and sometimes no error message was shown but it will still not work. 
Debugging this script and making sure i was able to get the required outcome gave me new abilities. Restricting other file types from being uploaded was an added feature and has helped me in my coding experience by not allowing any .php, .txt etc to be included in the directory only the extensions specified were allowed and also implementation of error messages really worked great.
